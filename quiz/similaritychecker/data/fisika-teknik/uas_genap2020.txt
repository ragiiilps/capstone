0) Initializing the Variables
Before you start working on the problems, let us perform an initialization to set up the value of
variables β1, β2, β3, β4 and β5 that we are going to use throughout this test. The values depend on
the combination of your own 6-digit NIU (Nomor Induk Universitas) and 5-digit NIF (Nomor
Induk Fakultas). The βi value is calculated using the following function:
Bi = 1 + (NIU+1 + NIFi ) modulo 6
Where NIUi+1 indicates the (i+1)-th digit of your NIU, and NIFi indicates the i-th digit of your
NIF. As an example, suppose that your NIU is 488263 and your NIF is 46238. We can arrange
the following table:
i 1 2 3 4 5 6
NIUi 4 8 8 2 6 3
NIUi+1 8 8 2 6 3 -
NIFi 4 6 2 3 8 -
NIUi+1 + NIFi 12 14 4 9 11 -
(NIUi+1 + NIFi) modulo 6 0 2 4 3 5 -
βi 1 3 5 4 6 -
Therefore, the βi values for your case are:
B1 = 1 ; B2 = 3 ; B3 = 5 ; B4 = 4 ; B5 = 6
Note : Your calculation must be WRONG if your βi value is less than ONE or more than SIX.
1) [25 points] Hanging Flower Pot
Consider a hanging flower pot shown in the figure above. For simplicity, let us assume that the flower pot is supported by 3 different strings (T1, T2 and T3) with length L given by L=(4B1×10) cm

2) [25 points] Measuring Speed of Sound
Jeon Jung-Kook (전정국), who is an electrical engineering student, is playing his flute inside his bedroom. However, the flute sounds out-of-tune, and he is 100% sure that the flute itself is fully fine, nothing is broken. So he thinks that the speed of sound inside his bedroom must be deviating from the normal value due to the temperature inside his bedroom.
To verify his hypothesis, he then prepares a simple experiment to measure the speed of sound inside his bedroom, adopting the concept of interference which he learnt in physics class. He uses a signal generator, 2 (two) speakers, a micropohone, an amplifier, and a voltmeter for his experiment. Signal generator and speakers are utilized to generate sound waves with a specific frequency, whereas the microphone, with the help of amplifier and voltmeter, is utilized to detect the resulting sound intensity generated by the two speakers.
Experimental Setup
The experimental setup is shown in the figure above. A sinusoidal wave with frequency f is generated by the signal generator. Then the two speakers, which are separated by distance d from each other, produce sound waves with the same frequency. Suppose that the speed of sound inside the room is vs.
a) [8 points] Determine the value of fmin and fmax, the sound frequency when the the two speakers produce destructive and constructive interference, respectively! Express your answer in terms of d and vs!
Experimental Data
Jung-Kook starts collecting experimental data by changing the frequency f generated by signal generator, and then he measures the resulting sound intensity using voltmeter. Let us assume that the relation between sound intensity I received by the microphone, and the voltage V measured by the voltmeter is given by 𝑉=𝑐|√𝐼|
where c is a proportional constant. The experimental data collected by Jung-Kook is shown in the table below.
Suppose that the distance between the two speakers is given by d=(B1B2×20)cm
b) [13 points] Based on this experimental data, please help Oppa Jung-Kook to determine the speed of sound vs inside his bedroom!
Validation
To verify whether his experimental result is valid or not, Jung-Kook performs one final experiment. He changes the distance between the speakers into 𝑑=(𝛽3𝛽4×10) 𝑐𝑚
Starting from 0 Hz, he then slowly increases the sound frequency generated by the speakers.
c) [4 points] At what frequency Oppa Jung-Kook will find the first destructive (fmin,1) and constructive (fmax,1) interference at this condition?
3) [25 points] Measuring Acceleration of Gravity
It is known that the oscillation period of a spring-mass system put on a horizontal table is given by 𝑇=2𝜋√𝑚𝑘
However, when the system is in vertical position, it can be proved that the oscillation period will be the same as the one in a horizontal position.
Based on this knowledge, Im Na-Yeon (임나연) performs an experiment to determine the acceleration of gravity inside her apartment. She only has a rubber band, 3 coins (500 Korean Won each), a cello tape, a ruler, and stopwatch from her smartphone. She then uses the cello tape to attach the coins to rubber band, and starts performing her experiment.
Experimental Data
Initially, the rubber band has length 𝐿𝑜=10 𝑐𝑚. She then puts the rubber band and coin system in a vertical position, and then measures the rubber band’s length L. Finally, she gives a small displacement to the coins, so that the system is oscillating up and down, and then she measures the oscillation period T. She then performs this experiment for different number of coins N, and the experimental data is shown in the table below. N L (cm) T (s)

4) [25 points] Why a Bicycle Pump is getting hot?
A bicycle pump is a device utilized for pumping bicylce tyres. A bicycle pump is getting hot (increase in temperature) during the pumping process compared to the temperature before the pumping process is started. In this problem, we want to take a look at the process of pumping a bicycle tyre, and to understand why there is an increase in temperature during the pumping process.
A bicycle pump consists of several parts as shown in the figure above. It consists of a cyclinder with a piston, connected to a handle, to compress or expand the air inside the cylinder. It also consists of a hose which is used to connect the pump cylinder with the tyre. Finally, it has 2 (two) valves (inlet and outlet valve) to control the air flow inside the pump. For simplicity, we will use the model shown in the figure above for our analysis. There are 3 (three) conditions that we would like to analyze during one pumping cycle as shown in the figure below.
For simplicity, we assume that the heat exchange between the pump, the tyre and the surrounding environment takes place rapidly so that the temperature inside the pump and the tyre are constant during one pumping cycle. We will assume also the tyre’s volume is constant during one pumping cycle. Finally, we will assume that the hose’s volume is very small compared to the volume of pump cylinder and tyre, so that it can be neglected in this problem.
Initial Condition
Initially, the pump is full of air with pressure Po, which is equal to the atmospheric pressure outside the pump, whereas inside the tyre, the pressure is Pt (Condition I). The temperature inside both pump and tyre are To.
a) [5 points] Determine the value of no and nt, number of mol inside the pump and inside the tyre, respectively! Express your answer only in terms of Po, Vo, Pt, Vt, To and universal gas constant R!
Process I
The air inside the pump is then compressed by pushing the piston down, increasing the pressure inside the pump and causing the inlet valve to close. This process is continued until the pressure inside the pump is equal to the pressure inside the tyre (Condition II).
b) [6 points] Determine the value of P1 and V1, air pressure and volume inside the pump at the end of Process I (Condition II), respectively! Express your answer only in terms of Po, Vo, and Pt!
c) [4 points] Determine the value of Q1, total heat added to/extracted from the pump during Process I! Express your answer only in terms of Po, Vo, and Pt!
Process II
Equal air pressure inside the pump and the tyre causes the outlet valve to open, and the air starts to flow from the pump into the tyre. This process is continued until all the air inside the pump has been pumped into the tyre (Condition III).
d) [6 points] Determine the value of P2, air pressure inside the tyre at the end of Process II (Condition III)! Express your answer only in terms of Po, Vo, Pt, and Vt!
e) [4 points] Determine the value of Q2, total heat added to/extracted from the pump during Process II! Express your answer only in terms of Po, Vo, Pt, and Vt!
Process III (Bonus Question)
One pumping cycle is finished by pulling the piston up, closing the outlet valve and opening the inlet valve. As the result, the air from outside the pump is flowing into the pump. This process is continued until the pump reaches its initial condition (Condition I).
f) [5 points] Determine the value of Q3, total heat added to/extracted from the pump during Process III!
g) [5 points] Finally, determine the value of Q, total heat added to/extracted from the pump during one pumping cycle! Based on this result, can you explain why the pump is getting hot during the pumping process?

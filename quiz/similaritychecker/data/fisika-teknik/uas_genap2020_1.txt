Hanging Flower Pot
Consider a hanging flower pot shown in the figure above. For simplicity, let us assume that the flower pot is supported by 3 different strings (T1, T2 and T3) with length L given by L=(4B1×10) cm
The flower pot can be modeled as a half-sphere with total weight W and radius R given by R=(B22×10)cm
a) Determine the value of η, which is defined as
𝜂=1−(𝑅𝐿)2
b) Suppose that the flower pot’s weight is given by
𝑊=(40×√B12−(B28)2)N
Determine the tension of all strings!
It is known that the maximum tension that can be allowed by the strings is Tmax=(B3×50)𝑁
before the strings break.
c) Determine the value of Wmax, the maximum flower pot’s weight that still can be supported by the strings!
